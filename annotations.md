Albrecht, R., & Baron, S. (2002). The politics of pedagogy: expectations and reality for information literacy in librarianship. *Journal of Library Administration*, 36 (1-2), 71–96. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J111v36n01_06](http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J111v36n01_06)

In this article, Albrecht and Baron (2002) emphasize the need for instructional and information literacy skills in academic libraries based on the evaluation of employment needs, following ACRL literacy standards and graduate student preparedness for meeting information literacy standards in the academic workplace. A survey and assessment of 49 School of Library and Information Science (SLIS) programs from U.S universities was conducted to compare the number of instructional courses that focused on pedological training. Albrecht and Baron (2002) note that despite 50% of an academic librarian’s time involves information literacy training to staff and students, most of the 49 SLIS programs offer instructional courses as an elective, instead of mandatory. Albrecht and Baron (2002) argue that graduates are ill prepared for the academic library workforce with more than 60% learning on the job without a solid understanding of the ACRL information literacy standards. `- Janie Hill`
