Albrecht, R., & Baron, S. (2002). The politics of pedagogy: expectations and reality for information literacy in librarianship. *Journal of Library Administration*, 36 (1-2), 71–96. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J111v36n01_06](http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J111v36n01_06)

> In this article, Albrecht and Baron (2002) emphasize the need for instructional and information literacy skills in academic libraries based on the evaluation of employment needs, following ACRL literacy standards and graduate student preparedness for meeting information literacy standards in the academic workplace. A survey and assessment of 49 School of Library and Information Science (SLIS) programs from U.S universities was conducted to compare the number of instructional courses that focused on pedological training. Albrecht and Baron (2002) note that despite 50% of an academic librarian’s time involves information literacy training to staff and students, most of the 49 SLIS programs offer instructional courses as an elective, instead of mandatory. Albrecht and Baron (2002) argue that graduates are ill prepared for the academic library workforce with more than 60% learning on the job without a solid understanding of the ACRL information literacy standards. *- Janie Hill*

> In this article, Badke (2010) argues that the concept of information literacy (IL) remains something of an enigma within academia. The reasons for this are plenty, but the most pressing issue according to the author is that both the nature and challenge of IL has been misunderstood and underestimated by academic faculty and administrators alike. As a result, IL has assumed the status of a remedial topic that does not require significant instruction rather than a valuable and relevant subject of study that will help students function in the information society and knowledge-based economy of the twenty-first century. Badke (2010) concludes that in order to lift the veil of invisibility that shrouds IL's place in higher education, more people have to recognize the “the need for skills to link the right information to the right situation” (p. 139). *- Adam Walser*
