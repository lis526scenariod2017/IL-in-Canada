## About

Although many definitions of the concept have been developed, information literacy (IL) is generally viewed as an understanding of how to access, use, and think critically about information. These skills and other associated competencies that fall under the rubric of IL are not only required in order to participate effectively in the information society and knowledge-based economy of the twenty-first century, but are part of the basic human right of lifelong learning. Despite this reality, many Canadians are not information literate and the state of information literacy education (ILE) in Canada has been found lacking. With this in mind, an ad-hoc group of school, public, and academic librarians, known as the Information Literacy Committee (ILC), was formed in the summer of 2017. Under the direction of the [Canadian Federation of Library Associations](http://cfla-fcab.ca/en/home-page/) (CFLA/FCAB), the ILC was tasked with developing a position statement on information literacy education (ILE) in Canada that can be used as the basis for a nationwide IL policy intended to help people make informed choices that will allow not only individual citizens, but the country as a whole to prosper in the digital age.

The work of the ILC, including the development of an [executive summary](https://lis526scenariod2017.github.io/IL-in-Canada/executivesummary/), a [presentation](https://lis526scenariod2017.github.io/IL-in-Canada/presentation/) intended for the next CFLA/FCAB Annual General Meeting (AGM), and a valuable archive of [resources](https://lis526scenariod2017.github.io/IL-in-Canada/resources/) have been made publicly available online via this website.

IL in Canada is aimed at CFLA members and executive council, but is open to all individuals and stakeholder groups who are interested in helping achieve our goal of an information literate Canada.

We value your feedback and welcome any comments, questions, or suggestions.
