### Position Statement

WHEREAS, information literacies are a hallmark of an educated, just, progressive society, and necessary for social, economic, political, and cultural advancement; and

WHEREAS, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) have identified information literacies and access as human rights issue impacting education and lifelong learning; and

WHEREAS, an ethical society must consider the variety of ways or processes in which information is received, retrieved, and disseminated; and

WHEREAS, increasing the ability of citizens to structure, find, understand, and use information is a central role of libraries and librarians; and

WHEREAS, there is no comprehensive, unified, federal Canadian information literacies curriculum and/or policy; and

WHEREAS, Canadians’ information literacies, particularly in the digital realm, are lagging behind world standards at the elementary, secondary and post-secondary levels, as well as in the general population; now, therefore, it is

RECOMMENDED by the CFLA/FCAB that:

1. The term “Information literacies” be employed to acknowledge the plurality, polymedia, and polycultural nature of knowledge acquisition, comprehension, and dissemination in Canada;

2. Information literacies be explicitly addressed in the Government of Canada’s “Innovation and Skills Plan”, and a nationwide policy be adopted;

3. Elementary and secondary school libraries develop comprehensive information literacies instruction plans and access federal monies assigned to this end;

4. Postsecondary libraries work with the Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL) to develop a nationwide information literacies instructional plan, and access any funds allocated to its implementation;

5. The Council of Ministers of Education, Canada (CMEC) include information literacies in their vision for Canadian education and acknowledge their importance in a joint statement addressing provincial and territorial school and postsecondary library policies; and

6. That public libraries include information literacies in their planning, access funding to deliver training, and offer comprehensive and ongoing informational education for members and staff.

This statement ASSUMES that:

1. All professional librarian education programs in Canada will include at least one required course in information
literacies education (ILE) and instruction.

2. Libraries will ensure that librarians have the time and resources to create the aforementioned opportunities;

3. Libraries will raise awareness of the importance of information literacy education as a distinct type of
learning that is essential for an informed citizenry;

4. It is recognized that information literacy skills and education are at the heart of lifelong learning and promotion
of these skills further encourages lifelong learning; and

5. Information literacies education reaffirms the role of librarians as educators and encourages librarians to
strengthen and promote this role.

### Background

As suggested in this position statement, the state of ILE in Canada is lacking. The term “information literacy” has been extant since coined by American Paul Zurkowski in 1974 (Bradley, 2013). The 1982 UNESCO Grûnwald Declaration may be the first to address the need for critical media literacy. The importance of informed citizenry in the information age, however, was first addressed by the American Library Association in 1989. The newly formed CFLA has, until now, been silent on this vital issue. However, within the national context, research has been circulating on the need for a Canada-wide policy for some time.

### Research

* The importance of ILE includes that it is a human right per UNESCO (Sturges & Gastinger, 2010; Bradley,
2013); knowledge is changing quickly and learning is lifelong (Farkas, 2012);

* The impact of ILE includes increased political agency (Smith, 2013), and participative citizenry; an educated
workforce and better national economic outlooks (Whitehead & Quinlan, 2002); knowledge creation and
learning for life (Bradley, 2013);

* The issues around ILE include that librarians are not being trained to deliver ILE (Albrecht & Baron, 2002)
but should be considered educational “partners” in knowledge acquisition (Shank & Bell, 2011); it is invisible
within academe (Badke, 2011); there is no IL policy in Canada (Bradley, 2013); information means different
things in different contexts and to different people (Cambre & Arshad-Ayaz, 2017); practical, community driven
skills should be the focus (Sturges & Gastinger, 2010).
